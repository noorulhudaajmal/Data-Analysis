## Perform exploratory data analysis on retail data with Python

### Project scenario
An online retail company is looking to interpret its data to help make key business decisions. They want you to use exploratory data analysis on their transactional data, which contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products, in order to help drive business decisions.

#### Skills demonstrated
- Python Programming
- Data Analysis
- Pandas
- Data Visualization (DataViz)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Tools used
- Python

### Summary
Using the power of Python and its readily available data analysis toolkit, I explored the data for trend analysis. The analysis could be leveraged by businesses to enhance profitability and success.

### Solution
The proposed solution achieved objectives through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Insights have been provided on sales trends, top selling products, busiest Sales month/days, and consumer behavior for informed data-driven recommendations to improved retail performance.

### Approach
I started by loading and cleaning the dataset, removing duplicates, and checking for handling missing data. After that reason for the unusual values was explored. Then, I conducted exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics and visualizations, to uncover insights about sales trends, top-selling products, and top consumer regions. Finally, I derived recommendations for improving retail performance based on these insights.
