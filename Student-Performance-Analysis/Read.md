## Student Performance Statistics
This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of student performance statistics using the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. The notebook covers various statistical measures, graphical representations, hypothesis testing, and conclusions regarding the mean math scores between male and female high school students.

#### Data Collection and Descriptive Statistics
In this section, the dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the math scores are calculated. Additionally, boxplots and histograms are generated to visualize the distribution of math scores.

#### Checking the Normality of Population
This section focuses on determining the normality of the math score population. The Pearson's coefficient of skewness is calculated, and outliers are identified using the interquartile range (IQR).

#### Estimation of Population Mean
Using the math scores data, the point estimate for the population mean is calculated, along with confidence intervals at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels. A normal distribution curve is plotted to visualize the distribution of math scores and the confidence intervals.

#### Hypothesis Testing
The research problem addressed in this section is whether there is a significant difference in the average math scores between male and female high school students. The null and alternative hypotheses are stated, and a two-sample t-test is conducted to compare the mean math scores of both groups. The critical value is determined, and the calculated t-statistic is compared to the critical value to make a conclusion.

#### Conclusion
Based on the hypothesis testing results, it is concluded that there is a significant difference in the mean math scores between male and female high school students.
